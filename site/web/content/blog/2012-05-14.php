<p>I've been using a git clone of KirbyCMS the past few days. I'm attempting to rebuild my organization's
website using it as a possible replacement for our current CMS. I've played with ditching this project
in lieu of KirbyCMS. But as I use Kirby, I'm asking myself here and there if I can force Kirby to do what
I want it to, and then the next question is if I can make Liriope do it instead.</p>

<p>So, I find myself continuing Liriope. And now I want to spend the time to find out... Can I build it?
Can I build my organization website with the same ease that I'm finding Kirby go together? But with
less snags?</p>
