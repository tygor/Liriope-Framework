<p>At NRHC, we consider the family THE most important ingredient. Simply, a church is not a building to
usâ€”it is the people. So if you are a young adult, or if you are a parent with young children, then
we have a ministry on Sunday morning that is designed for you and your children.</p>

<p>We also believe that a church is not only one day a week, coming to a building, then continuing your
week. We encourage small groups, community outreach, and missions. So, if your desire is to bring
glory to God through your life, join us in our Journey Groups with others moving in that
direction.</p>
