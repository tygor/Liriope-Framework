# Liriope
> Monkey Grass

A PHP framework. For no reason other than to exercise and learn more of PHP and
things web.

Liriope is a web backend for people who know PHP, HTML, CSS, and any other
frontend code. It's for us who write the web. It stemmed from a learning
project, but as the project got better, I decided to use it here and there.
Now, it's live on a few sites which is awesome and horrible at the same time.
Why? Because now I have issues and bugs that I want to fix.

## The name As it goes with code projects, they need a name, and generally a
person chooses something silly just to get it named, not expecting it to
thrive and become public. Well, Liriope isn't famous, and it's name means
nothing. It was a silly title, and it worked. I chose it for the abundant
flora in my back yard. And who doesn't like monkeys?
