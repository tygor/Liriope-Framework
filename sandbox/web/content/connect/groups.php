			<h2>Journey Group FAQ's:</h2>
			<dl class="question-answer">
				<dt class="rounded">When do Journey Groups normally meet?</dt>
				<dd>Most of our groups currently meet on Sunday or Wednesday nights.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">What is the purpose of Journey Groups?</dt>
				<dd>JG&rsquo;s are small (normally 6&ndash;12 people) group environments with the purpose of growing in friendship, faith in God, and mission.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">Where do they meet?</dt>
				<dd>Most meet in homes. Some meet in restaurants, coffee shops, or other public places.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">What does a Journey Group look like?</dt>
				<dd>Groups may gather based on geography, generation, or station in life. Some groups have a cross section of all of the above. Let us know your preferences and we will make recommendations accordingly.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">How often do they meet?</dt>
				<dd>The majority of our groups meet weekly. Most groups take breaks during the summer and holidays.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">Do I have to stay with the same Journey Group once I attend?</dt>
				<dd><strong>No</strong>. Sometimes it is best to &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; a group for a few weeks before making a final decision to stick. Although the JG you visit would love for you to stay with them&mdash;they also want God&rsquo;s best environment for you!</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">What do Journey Groups study?</dt>
				<dd>Studies are always changing. Some groups work off of a current sermon series, others study books of the Bible, and others may use other Christian study books. </dd>
				<dt class="rounded">What about my children?</dt>
				<dd>Groups with children normally either rotate childcare responsibilities in the home where they meet or pay a childcare worker to come to the home. We will help direct you to the groups that best match your childcare needs.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">How long does a Journey Group meeting last?</dt>
				<dd>Most last between 1&frac12; and 2 hours.</dd>
				<dt class="rounded">What's my next step to get connected with a Journey Group?</dt>
				<dd>The best step is to speak to someone in person from the JG Quick Connect Team on a Sunday morning @ the info booth. You can also email us: <a href="mailto:journeygroups@northrockhill.com">journeygroups@northrockhill.com</a> or complete an info card the next time you attend a Sunday morning gathering at NRHC.</dd>
