  <h1>Projects using Liriope</h1>
  <p>Right now, this list is very short, but as it grows, I hope to showcase the projects here. First on my list of uses is a company website for a local Construction Management company. If you dig deep enough in the commit on GitHub, you'll see them. Woops. I'll get to removing old implementation later.</p>
  <h2>Email Newsletter</h2>
  <p>One promising project that will knock down my TODO list is our church newsletter. My goal is to develop a filtering class that will comb through the output and move all styles inline, plus strip out all comments. The goal is a site that can be cut and paste into an email client HTML and sent. So, this will require a new theme (1980's HTML style), and a filter for inline CSS and comment removal.</p>
  <h2>Personal Site</h2>
  <p>Right now, the Liriope Framework is a one person project&mdash;me. So, saying this is used for my personal site is kind of a given. But honestly, as I'm writing this, my personal site is still using Wordpress but I truly intend to change that, so stay tuned. And using what I've built will help in bug fixes and feature developement. So again, stay tuned.</p>
