<div id="beliefs">
<p>Christians believe something unique. We believe that God has broken into our world, changed us by His grace, and set us free to become the people He created us to be. Faith leads to transformation, and transformation leads to action.</p>
<p>North Rock Hill intentionally focuses on the essentials of the Christian faith. The true church has always agreed on the essentials, and North Rock Hill unites in this rich tradition. We also recognize there are some differences of opinion among non-essentials, and in these areas we acknowledge liberty. In all areas we pursue love and charity.</p>

<dl class="beliefs-list">
  <dt>The Bible</dt>
  <dd>The Bible is God’s Word to Man, is completely true, and is the sole authority for Christian faith and practice.</dd>
  <dt>God</dt>
  <dd>There is only one true living God who eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God created and sustains all things.</dd>
  <dt>Jesus Christ</dt>
  <dd>Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah of the Old Testament, fully God and fully man. He led a sinless life, died as a substitute for our sins, was buried, and rose again in victory over death. He will one day return to reign eternally.</dd>
  <dt>Holy Spirit</dt>
  <dd>The Holy Spirit is sent from God to convict the world of sin and draw men to Jesus Christ. He gives each Christian direction and power for living, understanding of Scripture, and spiritual gifts.</dd>
  <dt>Mankind & Sin</dt>
  <dd>Mankind was created in the image of God, but has rebelled against God. This rebellion is called sin, and man’s slavery to sin separates it from God.</dd>
  <dt>Salvation</dt>
  <dd>Mankind’s slavery to sin yields it helpless in it’s rebellion, but God’s grace restores believers into fellowship with God. This salvation from sin is completely a work of God and not of man’s works or goodness. It occurs when sinners repent, receive Christ’s forgiveness for sin through faith, and commit to follow Christ as Lord. Because salvation is an act of God, it is eternally secure.</dd>
  <dt>Baptism & Communion</dt>
  <dd>Every believer is commanded by God to participate in the ordinances of baptism and communion. Baptism by immersion symbolically proclaims the believer’s identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. Communion, or the Lord’s Supper, is an act of worship in which the believer remembers God’s work of grace in Christ. Neither baptism nor communion provide salvation from sin.</dd>
  <dt>Church</dt>
  <dd>Jesus Christ established His church to continue His Kingdom mission and ministry on earth.</dd>
  <dt>Death & Resurrection</dt>
  <dd>When Christ returns, all mankind will be resurrected and face God’s judgment. Those who have experienced salvation will enter God’s eternal Kingdom, and the remaining lost will be judged for their sin and rebellion into eternal condemnation.</dd>
  <dt>Last Things</dt>
  <dd>Jesus Christ will return to earth and God’s plans for eternity will be carried out.</dd>
  <dt>Christian Faith & Practice</dt>
  <dd>Since Scripture is the final authority in all matters of Christian faith, North Rock Hill strives to follow Scripture’s instructions for living.  In areas where Scripture does not speak, North Rock Hill instructs believers to be led by the Lord.</dd>
