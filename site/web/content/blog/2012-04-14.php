<p>Liriope Framework now boasts a built in blog derrived from a file-based CMS.</p>

<h1>Blog, built-in</h1>

<p>The blog is working more to my liking now. Last night I added in a filter so that not all files were considered blog posts. Now, they are limited to PHP,
HTML, and TXT (soon to be configurable configuration setting).</p>

<p>This very post is a test of how things are truly going with the blog. Before yesterday, *.swp files were considered a "blog post" as so too would
have been any CSS, JS, or JPG files. But no longer!</p>

<p>With yesterday's conquring of the router, I'm feeling pretty good about the usability of Liripe as is. I may have to work on my "tagging" skills
to give Liripe a 0.1 or maybe a 1.0 (totally a 0.1). Once that is in place, I will definately be using Liriope for my
personal site (coder, developer, beta tester).</p>

<h2>Bug discovered while writing</h2>

<p>Sad, but ture. I just discovered that my blog is busted! I am writing this page with an HTML extension, and so the blog root page displays the intro
text as expected. Yet when I click over to read the entire article&hellip; 404! And that is because my other model "Folderfile" (I need a better name)
only sees PHP files at the moment. Time to change caps from blogger to developer. Back soon.</p>

<p>Didn't get this problem fixed tonight and I've noticed yet another problem. First, I'll rename this file to a PHP so that I can find this content
via the browser next time I get on. Now, the second issue is that the blog entry intro text shows in the blog entry page. Option 1) show only the intro
text on the list page and only everything after the readmore break on the entry page. Option 2, show only the intro text on the blog list and the intro
plus the remainder on the blog page.</p>
