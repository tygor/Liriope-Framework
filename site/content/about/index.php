<p>Liriope started in December of 2011. An article tutorial for building your own MVC framework sparked an interest in
finishing a framework that was light and self-made. A few more web searches added to the new framework and made it a
real possibility for powering small websites. A name was invented on the spot as I think most names are, so
Liriope kept growing.</p>
