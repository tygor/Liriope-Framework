  <p>I started the Liriope Framework to learn more about PHP and at the same time build my own framework. Along the way, I realized that this was becoming something useful for various websites I was thinking about or working on. I love it when your interests match up with your workload!</p>
  <p>This project is on GitHub, and I would love to include others in this learnining project. Please feel free to contribute. Find me on <a href="https://github.com/tygor/Liriope-Framework" target="_blank">GitHub</a>! </p>
