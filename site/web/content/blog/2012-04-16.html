<h1>File extension problem fixed</h1>
<p>The problem that Folderfile controller wasn't reading anything but PHP file has been fixed.
And hopefully this has made the site "quicker" since I gleaned out duplicate code in the
process, leaning on the already coded, and now rebuffed load.class.php.</p>
<p>I still haven't tackled the readmore-displaying-in-the-full-post issue. Maybe tonight
or tomorrow.</p>
