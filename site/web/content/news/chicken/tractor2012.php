<h1>Tractor</h1>
<p>The chicken tractor is sitting unused. It is still a functional chicken tractor and we use it for chicks. Our hens now live in the chicken coop which can hold far more than simply four chickens.</p>
<p>We build the coop for the chickens when we decided that we wanted them to be able to roam the yard. It's nice to have chickens walking about.</p>
