  <p>I've been writing PHP and HTML since college. I can home for break and with nothing else to do, I decided to learn HTML. After break, I went to the computer science department at the college and asked what would be the best coding language to learn. At that point, I had only played in Quick Basic and Visual Basic. One proffesor suggested PHP. So, I started playing in PHP as well as javascript and Macromedia Flash actionscript.</p>
  <p>After college, and so after the days of nested table structure, I delved into a PHP framework called Symfony. I built two different projects with Symfony 1.2&mdash;a CMS for the overseas mission sending company where I was working, and a Boy Scouts like group. They were both frontend/backend heavy and linked to databases. Symfony was world-changing, but getting more complex as they developed.</p>
  <p>Then I found SVN and eventually GIT which helped me organize working folders. This, coupled with how I am managing the content for my current full-time job's website encouraged me to seek my own CMS, without abandoning the MVC structure that I'm familiar with. And so, I am building Liriope.</p>
  <p>Rather than the database heavy site, I wanted this to be file driven CMS. There is a great file based CMS project out there and I have thought once or twice about abandoning Liriope and using KirbyMCS, but in the end, I want to learn, so kudos Kirby, but how else will I learn?</p>
