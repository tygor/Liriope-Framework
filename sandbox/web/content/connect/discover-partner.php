<h1>Connect @ NRHC</h1>

<p>Our hope is that every Christian would engage their friends, to affect their communities, to impact
their nations, all for the glory of Jesus. But to start, what's the first step?</p>

<p>We don't hope to latch you into a program or an activity, because what we perceive is that the
church building is merely a meeting place where ministry happens. Here is how to get connected.</p>
