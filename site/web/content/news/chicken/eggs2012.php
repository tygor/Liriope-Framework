<p>We have seven chickens, and we live within the city limits about two blocks from a university.
They usually give us between 3 and 5 eggs a day. This is not ideal since at one point we were
getting one per chicken. I'm not sure the reason, but even so, they do a great job fo eating bugs
and fertalizing wherever they walk.</p>
