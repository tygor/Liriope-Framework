<p>I've been working toward tags this project 0.1-BETA. This is a major milestone for me, my first BETA app!
At least, publically speaking.</p>

<p>The TODO comments have been gleaned out, and the features are working well. I have even been using Liriope on 
three different sites of dramatic difference to see how it works in a production environment. And agian, I think
that we're ready for BETA!</p>
