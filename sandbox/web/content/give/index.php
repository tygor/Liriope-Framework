    <p>For your security, online giving requires a NRHC account.  You
    will be able to give online immediately.  3-5 days after your account is created, you will also be
    able to view your contribution history online.</p>

  <blockquote>"The earth and everything in it, the world and its inhabitants, belong to the Lord" (Psalm 24:1)</blockquote>
  <p>The Bible teaches us that God created and owns everything, and He calls us to be stewards or managers of what is His. Scripture instructs us to invest in that which pleases God - His work in this world - and to do so cheerfully as an act of worship.</p>
  <p>Online giving allows you to invest in what's most important in a manner that is consistent and efficient. Online giving can be done one of two ways, and both help NRHC accomplish more with what you give.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Debit Card</strong><br /> Login to our secure site and use your debit card to make a one-time contribution or to schedule regular automated contributions. Automated contributions charge your debit card with the amount and frequency that you determine. You can also review your contributions history online.</li>
    <li><strong>Bill Pay through your bank</strong><br /> Most banks offer online bill pay as a way of sending regular contributions checks to the church office. Please have your checks sent to the address below and remember to put the contribution type in the memo line (general offering, What If..., etc.)<br /><br /><span class="indent">North Rock Hill Church<br />PO Box 2477<br />Rock Hill, SC 29732</span></li>
