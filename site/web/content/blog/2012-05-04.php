<h1>Let's think about this differently</h1>

<p>I need to think about this "blog" differently. My pages work. They pull from the CMS folder
and output to pages just fine. It's the other stuff that I'm trying to do that is messing up.</p>

<p>One thing that I want is the ability to insert CSS files and JS files, directed from the
page itself. So I need a way or method to "addCSS" or "addJS" that is acted on by _____ (what)?
The View, the $page (Page)?</p>
