<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>At it's core North Rock Hill believes that God is at work redeeming a lost and broken world. He
transforms people, and these transformed people become the instruments God uses to continue His
work. Relationships, families, cities, and the world are rescued as God uses redeemed in the places
they live, work, and play.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1997 North Rock Hill Church started with a small gathering in the living room of
founding Pastor Chris Ruppe. This group wanted to see Rock Hill changed for God's glory, and the
following Easter the first Sunday morning services were held at Rosewood Elementary. The years
following are evidence that God uses transformed people to change their city. Several schools, many
children without a home, and a high-crime neighborhood in our city are different because God has
graciously allowed us to be a part of His work there.</p>

<p>In November of 2011, a new chapter began as Jay Hardwick became the second Lead Pastor of North
Rock Hill. Jay is continuing to lead North Rock Hill to seek God's glory and His transforming work
in our lives, with effects reaching beyond our city to the nations.</p>
